# Graph
This is a project on informatics. It may be considered as a small graph editor, that involves creating multiple graphs, adding and
removing vertices and edges, moving vertices in one plane, and colorizing each of them. As features it also involves scalable 
radius of vertices and width of edges, ediable comments attached to edges, and enumeration of vertices.
